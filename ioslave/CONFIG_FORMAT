Every DNS-SD service type used with zeroconf:/ ioslave needs
configuration file in $DATADIR/zeroconf with name matching service type.
Used entries:

Type      	- obligatory, must match file name 
Name	  	- obligarory, specifies user friendly name shown in konqueror/ file dialog
Name[language]  - optional, contains the localized friendly name. E.g. Name[gb]=Colour server
Exec      	- optional, specifies executable for helper service - used if service has no
		  corresponding helper protocol
Protocol  	- optional, specifies real protocol name, will be taken from service name
	   	  if not set (for example _ssh._tcp => ssh://)
Icon	  	- optional, if not set will be taken from protocol
PathEntry 	- optional, contains name of attribute carrying path
UserEntry 	- optional, contains name of attribute carrying user name
PasswdEntry	- optional, contains name of attribute carrying password


Examples:

Name=FTP servers
Type=_ftp._tcp
PathEntry=path
UserEntry=u
PasswordEntry=p

Protocol is taken from service type (ftp), if service is announced with attributes path, u or p, it
will be inserted into resolved URL.
Service published with: Name="Public files", type="_ftp._tcp", port=7773, attributes: path=/home/test/public_files,
u=test, p=public on hostname "Storage" will be resolved into ftp://test:public@Storage.local/home/test/public_files

-----


Name=Remote shell (ssh)
Type=_ssh._tcp
UserEntry=u
PasswordEntry=p


Resolved URL will be ssh://user:password@machine:port/ . ssh is helper protocol so ktelnetservice will be launched for
this URL.



-----------

Name=Battleship games
Type=_kbattleship._tcp
Exec=kbattleship %u

URL will be resolved into kbattleship://host:port, then "kbattleship kbattleship://host:port" will be launched
